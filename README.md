### What I Learned

This project helped reinforce my understanding of:

- Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Managing component state and props in React
- Implementing accessible and interactive UI elements
- Using Vite for fast React development

```jsx
// Example: React component structure
function BlogCard({ title, description }) {
  return (
    <div className="blog-card">
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Explore advanced accessibility features
- Improve animation and transition effects
- Refine component reusability and modularity
